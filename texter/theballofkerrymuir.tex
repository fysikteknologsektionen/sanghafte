\begin{song}{The ball of Kerrymuir}{theballofkerrymuir}
\begin{vers}
There were four-and-twenty virgins\\
Coming up from Inverness\\
And when the ball was over there were\\
Four-and-twenty less\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls to your partner\\
And your arse against the wall\\
If you don't get fucked on a Saturday night\\
You'll never get fucked at all.
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
There was fucking in the kitchen\\
There was fucking in the halls\\
You couldn't hear the music\\
For the clanging of the balls\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls ..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
The village cripple he was there, he wasn't up too much\\
He lined them up against the wall,and fucked them with his crutch\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls ..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
The village idiot he was there, sitting on a pole\\
He pulled his foreskin over his head, and whistled through the hole\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Now little Tommy he was there, but he was only eight\\
He couldn't fuck the women, so he had to masturbate\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
The postman, he was also there, the poor man had the pox\\
He couldn't fuck the lassies, so he fucked the letter-box\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
The examinator, he was there, working out a sum;\\
He figured out by logarithms, the time that he would come\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Jock the parson, he was there, it was a bloody shame;\\
Loved a lassie thirty times and never knew her name\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Winston Churchill, he was there, down behind the bar\\
And when he couldn't get it up, he used his big cigar\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls..\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
And when the ball was over, then everyone confessed\\
They all enjoyed the music but the fucking was the best!\\
\end{vers}
\begin{vers}
Swing your balls..\\
\end{vers}
\end{song}
